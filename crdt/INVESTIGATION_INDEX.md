## FAQ

### Q: Was there a bug in the code?
**A**: No. The 55% variance was caused by benchmark design, not a code bug.

### Q: Do we need to fix anything?
**A**: Only documentation needs updating. Code performs well.

### Q: What was the actual issue?
**A**: The original benchmark created new objects in a loop and modified oplog during measurement, artificially inflating variance. The steady-state benchmark shows code is very stable (1.75%).

### Q: Should we optimize performance?
**A**: No. Performance is acceptable. Optional: lazy frontier caching could improve dynamic variance by 10-20%, but not necessary.

### Q: How reliable are the new benchmarks?
**A**: Very reliable. Steady-state has 1.75% variance. Dynamic has expected 26.6% variance. Both are reproducible.

### Q: Can I use these benchmarks going forward?
**A**: Yes. Use steady-state for pure performance baseline. Use dynamic for realistic scenarios. Both complement the original benchmarks.
