## Current Architecture Analysis

### ✅ What You Already Have

Your implementation is **already very close** to eg-walker! You have:

1. **Causal Graph** (`/causal_graph/graph.mbt`)
   - ✅ Parent tracking (causal dependencies)
   - ✅ Agent/Seq identification (RawVersion)
   - ✅ Lamport timestamps
   - ✅ Frontier management
   - ✅ Transitive closure (`transitive_closure()`)
   - ✅ Graph diffing (`graph_diff()`)
   - ✅ Ancestry checks (`is_ancestor()`)

2. **Operation Log** (`/oplog/oplog.mbt`)
   - ✅ Append-only operation storage
   - ✅ Remote operation merging
   - ✅ Frontier-based versioning

3. **CRDT Data Structure** (`/fugue/tree.mbt`)
   - ✅ FugueMax tree for ordered sequences

## ✅ Implemented Eg-walker Components

### 1. ✅ Event Graph Walker (COMPLETED)

**Location:** `/causal_graph/walker.mbt` and `/oplog/walker.mbt`

The core algorithm that traverses the operation graph in topological order.

**Implemented:**
- `CausalGraph::walk_from_frontier(frontier)` - Topological sort in causal order
- `OpLog::walk_and_collect(frontier)` - Collect operations at frontier
- `OpLog::diff_and_collect(from, to)` - Diff two frontiers
- Multiple convenience methods (walk_all, walk_recent, walk_range, etc.)

All walker methods use method style (`self`) and have comprehensive tests.

### 2. ✅ Branch/Snapshot System (COMPLETED)

**Location:** `/branch/branch.mbt`

Efficient document state computation from operations.

**Implemented:**
```moonbit
pub struct Branch {
  frontier : Array[Int]       // Version frontier this branch represents
  tree : @fugue.FugueTree     // CRDT tree state at this frontier
  oplog : @oplog.OpLog        // Reference to the operation log
}

/// Checkout document state at a frontier
pub fn Branch::checkout(oplog : @oplog.OpLog, frontier : Array[Int]) -> Branch

/// Advance a branch by applying new operations
pub fn Branch::advance(self : Branch, target_frontier : Array[Int]) -> Branch
```

**Features:**
- Efficient checkout using walker to apply operations in causal order
- Incremental advance (only applies new operations when possible)
- Full test coverage (12 tests) including concurrent inserts and complex operations
- Character-level operations (multi-character strings must be split into individual operations)

### 3. ✅ Version Vectors (COMPLETED)

**Location:** `/causal_graph/version_vector.mbt`

Compact representation of known versions per agent.

**Implemented:**
```moonbit
/// Version vector - tracks max sequence per agent
pub struct VersionVector {
  map : Map[String, Int]
} derive(Eq, ToJson, FromJson)

/// Create, get, set operations
pub fn VersionVector::new() -> VersionVector
pub fn get(self : VersionVector, agent : String) -> Int?
pub fn set(self : VersionVector, agent : String, seq : Int) -> VersionVector

/// Comparison and merging
pub fn VersionVector::op_equal(self : VersionVector, other : VersionVector) -> Bool
pub fn VersionVector::op_le(self : VersionVector, other : VersionVector) -> Bool
pub fn merge(self : VersionVector, other : VersionVector) -> VersionVector

/// Check if a version is covered by this vector
pub fn includes(self : VersionVector, agent : String, seq : Int) -> Bool

/// Convert to/from frontier
pub fn to_frontier(self : VersionVector, graph : CausalGraph) -> Array[Int]
pub fn from_frontier(graph : CausalGraph, frontier : Array[Int]) -> VersionVector
```

**Network Integration Completed:**
- Network sync now uses version vectors instead of frontiers (`web/src/network.ts`)
- `merge_operations()` accepts version vector for optimization
- Early return optimization when `remote_vv <= local_vv` (already synced)
- 329 tests passing including 25 property-based tests with Arbitrary/Shrink traits

### 4. ✅ Efficient Merge (COMPLETED)

**Location:** `/merge/merge.mbt`

Merge concurrent branches efficiently using retreat-advance-apply strategy.

**Implemented:**
```moonbit
/// MergeContext - state during merge operation
pub struct MergeContext {
  tree : @fugue.FugueTree
  oplog : @oplog.OpLog
}

/// Perform a full merge operation (three-phase retreat-advance-apply)
pub fn merge(
  tree : @fugue.FugueTree,
  oplog : @oplog.OpLog,
  current_frontier : Array[Int],
  target_frontier : Array[Int]
) -> Unit

/// Merge remote operations into local state using Branch system
pub fn merge_remote_ops(
  tree : @fugue.FugueTree,
  oplog : @oplog.OpLog,
  remote_ops : Array[@oplog.Op]
) -> Unit

/// Apply operations from the advance set
pub fn MergeContext::apply_operations(
  self : MergeContext,
  operations : Array[Int]
) -> Unit

/// Remove operations from the retreat set
pub fn MergeContext::retreat_operations(
  self : MergeContext,
  operations : Array[Int]
) -> Unit
```

**Features:**
- Three-phase merge: retreat-advance-apply
- Uses `graph_diff()` to compute retreat and advance sets
- `merge_remote_ops()` leverages Branch system and walker
- 3 comprehensive tests covering concurrent inserts, deletes, and frontier transitions
- All tests passing

### Baseline Performance Results

**Status**: ✅ Baseline established (2026-01-09)

Performance analysis completed with comprehensive results:
- ✅ **Version vectors**: Excellent (0.08-2.21 µs)
- ✅ **Small-medium documents** (≤1000 ops): Good performance
