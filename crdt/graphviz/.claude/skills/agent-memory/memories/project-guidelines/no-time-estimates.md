# Documentation Guidelines: No Time Estimates

## Rule

**Do not include time estimates in any documentation.**

## Rationale

Time estimates in documentation are always wrong and provide no value. They create false expectations and become outdated quickly.

## What to Avoid

- "This will take 2-3 weeks"
- "We can do this later"
- "This is a quick fix"
- Any other time-based projections

## What to Do Instead

- Provide concrete implementation steps without timelines
- Focus on **what** needs to be done, not **when**
- Break work into actionable steps
- Let users/stakeholders decide scheduling based on priorities
